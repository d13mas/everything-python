# everything-python

I'll be creating Python PoC with different objectives:

- Testing libraries
- Testing algorithms
- Optimizing complexity abd use of resources
- etc.

## bfs.py

This function implements a simple `Breath First Search` algorithm version
TO DO:

- Implement the queue
- Implement the search condition to exit

## longestCommonPrefix.py

Implements a memory optimized version of finding the longest prefix among and array of strings
